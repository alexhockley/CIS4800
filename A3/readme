Assignment 3

to run:
unpack from archive
type make
run ./a3


deficiencies and notes:

The textures seem to be a bit glitchy, a few of them appear to be half-and-half with another texture
The shadow looks a bit off, i think its at an angle to the plain
Texture file names are hardcoded, wasnt sure if this was the intended method, it wasnt specified in the
