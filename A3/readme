deficiencies and notes:

The surface and vertex normals are calculated, although i could not get them shading properly.
If you wish to see how they are calculated, they are in their respective functions, if that matters.

There are a few missing features
 - camera does not rotate around the point
 - shading does not work properly with the normals
 - colour variations not implemented
 - there is some leftover useless sample code in the display function, trying to remove it just ended up with
   nothing being displayed, so i left it in because i dont have time to fiddle with that
 - vertex normals were not calculated with OpenGL in mind, so i cant actually call glNormal3f on them with
   the current data structure to assign them to the correct points. Basically, points arent shared properly
