Assignment 4
Ray Tracing

Setup:
Extract archive and type make

run ./a <filename>

I have provided a test file which showcases 3 spheres of varying sizes and some overlap between two of them.


Deficiencies:
- Specular Lighting is not implemented (it was causing some pretty wonky stuff)
- Shadows are not implemented
- Persective ray tracing not implemented, its dumb straight-on tracing
